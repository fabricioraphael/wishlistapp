## Requirements:

###### One of the most interesting functionalities in an e-commerce platform is the Wishlist, or the list of desired items. In an e-commerce platform, a customer can search for products or access the product details page. On both screens, they can select preferred products and store them in their Wishlist. At any time, the customer can view their complete Wishlist, displaying all the products they have selected on a single screen.

- Add a product to the customer's Wishlist.
- Remove a product from the customer's Wishlist.
- Retrieve all products from the customer's Wishlist.
- Check if a specific product is in the customer's Wishlist.
